### **Simplified Steps for Learning Databases**:

1. **Get the Basics Right**:
   - **Start with the [SQL Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/sql)** to understand what you’ll learn.
   - Watch the **[SQL Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlGoQC332VM)** video to understand the foundational concepts.
   
2. **Master Core SQL**:
   - Use **[InterviewBit SQL Interview Questions](https://www.interviewbit.com/sql-interview-questions/)** for practice. Don’t just read; try solving a few queries yourself.

3. **Dive into Advanced Concepts**:
   - Once you’re comfortable with basic queries, watch the **[Advanced SQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQPpP2ywA9k)** to understand subqueries and optimization techniques.

4. **Apply Your Knowledge**:
   - Work on a small **[Real-world Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlGoQC332VM)** to understand how databases work in real scenarios.

### **Quick Questions to Test Your Progress**:
1. What is the difference between **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN**?
2. Can you write an SQL query to find the second-highest salary in a table?
3. What is normalization in databases? Can you explain it with an example?

This way, the guide feels more digestible, focusing on smaller chunks of learning without overwhelming you!
